# Security-Header-Analyzer
##  Project Description  
The *Security Header Analyzer* is a web-based tool that helps users analyze the security headers of any website.  
Security headers are essential for protecting web applications from attacks such as *Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), Clickjacking, and MIME-type sniffing*.  
This tool helps website owners, security professionals, and ethical hackers identify missing security measures and provides recommendations for improvement.  

### Features

Fetch HTTP response headers and display them in an easy-to-read format.  
Check for missing headers and highlight security risks.  
Simple and user-friendly interface using Flask, HTML.  

#### How It Works  
The user need to enter a website URL into the input field.  
The application sends a request to the website and fetches its HTTP headers.  
The headers are analyzed against security best practices.  
The results are displayed, indicating *which security headers are present and which are missing*.
